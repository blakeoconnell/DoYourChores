# DoYourChores
Simplistic iOS app which allows a user to randomly assign chores to specified people. This app utilizes CoreData to persist data locally on the device. A future wish of mine is to replace the CoreData with Firebase and allow for users to connect and see the assignments on different devices.

# What I learned
